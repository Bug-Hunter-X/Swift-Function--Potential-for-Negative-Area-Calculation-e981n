# Swift Function: Potential for Negative Area Calculation

This repository demonstrates a potential error in a Swift function that calculates the area of a rectangle.  The function does not explicitly handle negative input values, potentially leading to incorrect results.

The `bug.swift` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.swift` file shows a corrected version that handles negative inputs gracefully.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in Swift functions.
